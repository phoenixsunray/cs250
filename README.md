Portfolio Reflection: README Entry
How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
Understanding user needs begins with communication and empathy. By putting myself in the user’s position, I can translate vague requirements into actionable development goals. Creating user stories is essential to this process. User stories break down broad objectives into focused, testable tasks framed from the user’s perspective. This not only helps define clear acceptance criteria but also keeps development user-centered and iterative.

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
My development process starts with planning and continues through frequent testing and feedback. I now approach programming with an Agile mindset—focusing on short, manageable sprints, continuous integration, and regular team communication. I hope to continue using Scrum practices such as sprint reviews, retrospectives, and backlog grooming in future projects. These Agile practices keep work organized, adaptable, and closely aligned with stakeholder needs.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member means being accountable, communicative, and respectful. In Agile development, collaboration is constant, and success depends on shared responsibility. A good team member actively contributes ideas, supports others during challenges, and delivers work on time. Importantly, they also give and receive feedback constructively during retrospectives, helping the team improve over time.
